## Description
Command-line application that dynamically generates a README.md from a user's input. The user is prompted for their Github username and a series of questions follows where the user inputs information about their project. This generator is intended to hasten and standardise the writing of README files, whose importance is often understated. This allows creators to devote more time to developing the actual project in comparison to the README, without sacrificing the quality of the README. 

## Installation
npm i

## Usage
Use in conjunction with node.js

## Testing
npm test

## Licensing
None

## Contributing to the project
